## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### <span class="date">January 2024 – Present</span> Computational Scientist
*The Rockefeller University, Elizabeth R. Miller Brain Observatory* | New York, NY

- Developed computational pipelines integrating **GPU-accelerated registration**, cell segmentation, and automated quality control for planar and volumetric **calcium imaging** and light sheet microscopy datasets.
- Maintain **local deployments of** standard neuroimaging libraries (**Cellpose, Suite2p, CaImAn**) for use with custom data formats, upstreaming performance improvements for volumetric data handling (achieved **10x speedup**).
- Developed interactive visualization tools for **GB-TB scale imaging data** - **fastplotlib** for image rendering, **imgui** for interactivity, and a **lazy-loading I/O backend** for responsiveness at scale. Integrates directly with Cellpose and Suite2p for segmentation / model training workflows.
- Created "MBO Compute Hub," a documentation platform with computational workflows, user guides, and best practices for calcium imaging data analysis. 
- **Served as Teaching Assistant** for workshops on neurophysiology data visualization and calcium imaging parameter exploration using CaImAn and fastplotlib.
- Maintain multi-user Windows Server workstations and storage servers with guides and pre-configured environments for team members.

### <span class="date">September 2023 – January 2024</span> Software Engineer
*Cornell University, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior* | Ithaca, NY

- Implemented in-house spike sorting pipelines for automated, high-fidelity neuronal spike sorting.
- Developed batch processing routines for use on high-performance computing clusters.
- Standardized statistical workflows and data pipelines across multiple Neurobiology and Psychology laboratories.

### <span class="date">December 2018 – August 2023</span> Research Technician II
*Binghamton University, Department of Psychology* | Binghamton, NY

- Led end-to-end experimental studies from surgical implantation through data collection, analysis, and publication.
- Implemented **Support Vector Machines** for neuronal activity classification.
- Developed Python packages and **standalone scripts** to facilitate data collection (via Inscopix Software) and **calcium imaging** analysis from imaging systems and experimental hardware.
- Converted MATLAB pairwise-distance algorithms in **Python** and **Rust**.
- Performed stereotaxic surgeries for electrode implantation, virus injection, GRIN lens placement for in vivo calcium imaging, and optical fiber implantation for optogenetics
- Trained lab members in surgical techniques, microscopy, and electrophysiology; managed daily lab operations.
